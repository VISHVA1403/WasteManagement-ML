# Backend Server for Waste Management System

This repository contains the backend server code for a comprehensive waste management system aimed at optimizing waste collection, promoting recycling, and fostering sustainable urban environments.

## Project Overview

The waste management system utilizes IoT-equipped waste bins integrated with a centralized backend server to monitor and manage waste disposal activities in urban areas. By leveraging real-time data collection, intelligent waste segregation, and community engagement strategies, the system aims to address key challenges in traditional waste management practices and promote environmental sustainability.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: The system employs IoT technology to monitor the fill level of waste bins in real-time, enabling efficient waste collection and route optimization.
- **Intelligent Segregation**: Advanced algorithms are implemented to categorize waste materials based on type (e.g., recyclable, non-recyclable) and prioritize collection accordingly.
- **RESTful APIs**: The backend server provides a robust set of RESTful APIs for seamless integration with frontend applications, enabling data retrieval, user authentication, and system configuration.
- **Data Insights and Analytics**: The system generates comprehensive analytics and reports on waste patterns, recycling rates, environmental impact, and operational efficiency, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions.
- **Community Engagement**: User-friendly mobile applications are developed to engage residents and businesses in responsible waste disposal practices, promoting recycling initiatives, and fostering a sense of environmental stewardship.
